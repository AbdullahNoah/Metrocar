# Metrocar

Metrocar Project Overview
Our Metrocar project dives deep into understanding and improving the user experience and operational efficiency of our ride-hailing app. Through meticulous analysis, we've identified key areas for enhancement and developed targeted strategies to address them. This project showcased our team's problem-solving abilities, analytical skills, and dedication to presenting clear results, all while working cooperatively and managing our time efficiently.

# What We Did
- Funnel Analysis

- - Users Analysis: We tracked the user journey from downloading the app to requesting rides. The good news? Users are finding value quickly, but there's a significant drop-off when it comes to completing rides.
- - Rides Analysis: We looked closely at how rides are accepted and completed. While 90% of accepted rides go smoothly, 35.6% of ride requests never get accepted, highlighting a need for better driver availability and matching.
Understanding Our Users

- Waiting Times and Cancellations: We found that longer waiting times lead to more canceled rides, especially during peak hours like morning and evening commutes.
Demographics: Most of our users are between 35-44 years old, using Metrocar primarily for commuting.
- Platform Preferences: The majority of our users are on iOS (60.9%), with fewer on Android (29.1%) and web (10%).
- User Feedback: While many rides receive high ratings, a concerning 39.5% of ratings are low, with complaints about driver behavior, vehicle conditions, and service reliability.
Key Insights
- Ride Completion Issues: Only half of the ride requests are completed, suggesting we need to streamline our process.
Acceptance Rates: With a 64.4% acceptance rate, we need to better match riders with available drivers.
- Waiting Time Impact: Longer waiting times during rush hours are causing more cancellations.
- Platform Optimization: Our iOS app needs improvements to cater to the majority of our users.
Addressing User Concerns: Negative feedback points to the need for better driver training, vehicle maintenance, and overall service reliability.

# Skills Utilized
- Problem-Solving: Identified key issues impacting ride completion and user satisfaction, and developed strategic solutions to address them.
Analyzing: Conducted detailed funnel and user behavior analysis to uncover insights.
- Presenting Results: Clearly communicated findings and recommendations through well-structured presentations.
- Teamwork and Cooperation: Collaborated effectively across our team, leveraging each member's strengths.
- Time Management: Managed our time efficiently to ensure timely completion of the project milestones.
- Cohesive Structure Building: Ensured all aspects of the project were interconnected and aligned towards the common goal.
